# Garbage Collection

## Challenges

1. The Obj header struct at the top of each object now has three fields: `type`, `isMarked`, and `next`. How much memory do those take up (on your machine)? Can you come up with something more compact? Is there a runtime cost to doing so?

2. When the sweep phase traverses a live object, it clears the `isMarked` field to prepare it for the next collection cycle. Can you come up with a more efficient approach?

3. Mark-sweep is only one of a variety of garbage collection algorithms out there. Explore those by replacing or augmenting the current collector with another one. Good candidates to consider are reference counting, Cheneyâ€™s algorithm, or the Lisp 2 mark-compact algorithm.
