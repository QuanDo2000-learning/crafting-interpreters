# Introduction

## Notes

- There are 2 implementations of interpreters
- There is general-purpose language, and there are "little languages" or "domain-specific languages"
  - Exampe
    - Make
    - YAML
    - Emacs Lisp
    - cpp
    - INI
    - JSON
    - Vim Script
    - Bash
    - Batch
    - CSS
    - HTML
    - XML
    - SQL
    - Tcl
    - ASP.NET
- There are tools like [Yacc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc) or Bison (compiler-compiler) to generate source files for an implementation
- First interpreter is writen in Java, the second is written in C

## Challenges

**1. There are at least six domain-specific languages used in the little system I cobbled together to write and publish this book. What are they?**

The languages are:

- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- Markdown
- XML
- Makefile
- Dart

**2. Get a "Hello, world!" program written and running in Java. Set up whatever makefiles or IDE projects you need to get it working. If you have a debugger, get comfortable with it and step through your program as it runs.**

**3. Do the same thing for C. To get some practice with pointers, define a doubly linked list of heap-allocated strings. Write functions to insert, find, and delete items from it. Test them.**
